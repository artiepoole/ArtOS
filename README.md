# ArtOS
ArtOS is a very basic operating system which started from [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) tutorials but which quickly outgrew them. 

The aim of this project is simply to learn. If it becomes something I want others to be able to use I will add the typical sections to this README.

## Progress markers

**Running DOOM (1993):**

p.s. it runs smoothly (easily achiving the hardcoded 35 fps) but the video recording and compression makes it look clunky 

**Loading Screen and Keyboard:**

## My Goals
- [x] **Basics**
- - [x] Boot into hello world
- - [x] Text mode terminal newline Character
- - [x] Text mode terminal Scrolling
- - [x] Colour Art
- - [x] Serial PORT1 output from kernel
- - [x] Pixel mode text support
- - [x] Draw "art" in pixel mode    
- - [x] Replace grub and multiboot with grub2 and multiboot2
- [ ] **Interrupts and time**
- - [x] Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) are targeted on interrupt using a partially filled Interrupt Descriptor Table
- - [x] Interrupt Requests (IRQ) can be handled
- - [x] IRQ0 targets a timer decrementor to allow for scheduling and waiting.
- - [x] Kernel sleep (block until n ticks occur)
- - [x] Replace PIC with APIC
- - [x] Real time clock implemented
-
    - [x] Configure LAPIC timer for scheduling
- [ ] **User IO**
- - [x] Keyboard
- - [ ] Mouse
- - [ ] Shell environment
- [ ] **Hardware detection and support**
- - [x] SMBIOS detection
- - [x] PCI device detection
- - [x] IDE detection
- - [ ] IDE initialisation (currently supports CD ROM only, see storage)
- - [x] Initialise frame buffer etc using the multiboot2 data instead of hard coded
- - [ ] Detection and selection of video modes i.e. reconfiguring the VGA hardware
- [ ] **Storage**
- - [x] Attach a RW storage device in Qemu
- - [x] Read data from CD ROM using PCI IDE DMA BusMastering
- - [x] Use data from CD ROM i.e. parse .iso file system
- - [ ] Support virtual attached RW storage
- - [ ] Support path strings or similar filename access
- - [ ] Detect and mount/unmount storage devices on real hardware
- - [ ] USB storage support
- [ ] **Filesystem**
- - [x] Create a directory tree from iso fs data
- - [x] Implement a rudimentary filesystem
- - [ ] implement proper pdclib compliant filehandling
- [ ] **PDCLIB**
- - [x] Implement C standard library for kernel space
- - [x] Load a file using pdclib
- - [ ] User space functionality (e.g. exit, raise, signal)   
- [ ] **DOOM**
- - [x] Play DOOM for ArtOS!
- - [x] Play DOOM for ArtOS on real hardware
- - [x] Loading from CD ROM instead of baked into the binary
- - [ ] Loading from boot USB 
- - [ ] Run in user space
- - [ ] Add sound
- - [ ] Add save game support
- [ ] **Optimisations**
- - [x] Basic SIMD for memcpy, memmove and memset
- - [ ] Advanced SIMD usage (string operations and vector maths)
- - [ ] Ther are many other optimisations to consider
- [ ] **Path to User Space**
- - [x] Use Paging/virtual memory
- - [x] Proper handling of a scheduler to allow for sleeping of a task
- - [ ] Implement a standard library for user space
- - [ ] Run an executable
- - [ ] Self hosting compiler
- [ ] **Misc**
- - [ ] Remove resolution specific baked in splash screen with centered graphic (can be scaled) and programatically drawn borders. Bring back the loading bar? 
- [ ] **Stretch goals**
- - [ ] higher half and 64-bit support
- - [ ] ARM support (raspberry pi zero?)
- - [ ] Multithreading
- - [ ] Networking
- - [ ] USB support
- - [ ] Window manager and windows
- - [ ] Graphics driver(s)

mtools
```

make a disk image using:
`qemu-img create external_resources/ArtOS_HDD.img 512M` and change 512M to any size you like.
