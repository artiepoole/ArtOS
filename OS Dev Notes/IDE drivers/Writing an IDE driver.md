# This is a WIP, tutorial type document.

Much
of
the
information
required
to
read
an
ISO
filesystem
from
a
CD-ROM
device
using
DMA
is
obfuscated
or
difficult
to
find.
Here,
I
am
trying
to
create
one
concise
document
which
contains
the
information (
or
links
to
it)
which
was
scattered
among
many
sources.
For
example,
SCSI
command
packets
and
their
appropriate
controls
are
not
freely
available
in
full,
and
several
manuals
are
required
to
implement
DMA,
IDE
and
SCSI
all
together.
Similarly,
I
simply
couldn't
find
some
of
the
information
I
needed,
so
this
document
hopes
to
bridge
those
gaps
and
fill
it
in
with
some
results
of
trial,
error
and
me
banging
my
head
against
metaphorical
walls.

This
was
written
using
Obsidian (
note
taking
app)
with
the
intention
for
the
user
to
read
it
in
the
same
app.
A
PDF
version
will
be
exported
periodically.

# CD ROM IDE BusMastering DMA

https://archive.org/details/spc2r20/page/n45/mode/2up

An
IDE
controller
is
an
intermediary
between
a
storage
device
and
CPU/memory.
An
Integrated
Drive
Electronics (
IDE)
controller
performs
translation
of
standard
commands
into
communication
for
specific
storage
device
types.
This
means
that
using
an
IDE
controller
for
use
with
a
SATA
device
is
much
the
same
as
when
using
a
PATA
device,
and
the
user
does
not
need
to
know
the
difference.

For
each
PCI
IDE
Controller
device,
there
are
two
IDE
channels
on
board (
named
primary
and
secondary)
supporting
two
drives
each (
named
Main
and
Alt
in
this
documentation,
replacing
Master
and
Slave).
That's
a
total
of
4
drives
per
IDE
controller.
Simultaneous
read/write
is
not
handled
in
this
tutorial,
but
is
possible (
if
the
controllers
and
attached
devices
support
it).

BusMastering (
BM)
Direct
Memory
Access (
DMA)
if
a
form
of
communication
between
memory
a
device.
In
this
configuration,
a
DMA
controller (
a
PCI
device)
is
given
control
of
the
bus,
and
enables
data
to
be
transferred
between
a
device
controlled
by
the
DMA
controller
and
memory,
independent
of
the
CPU.
There
are
also
two
channels
on
an
IDE
BM
DMA
controller,
one
for
each
IDE
controller.
These
are
names
Primary
and
Secondary
and
correspond
to
the
IDE
channels
mentioned
above. !

an
IDE
controller
supports
BM
DMA

## Process overview:

There
are
a
few
overarching
steps
for
setting
up
and
using
IDE
BM
DMA:

1.
*
*Discovery
**:
Discover
devices
and
find
the
necessary
ports
or
memory
addresses
to
communicate
with
the
PCI
controller,
BusMaster
controller
and
IDE
controller.
2.
*
*Configuration
**:
Configure
each
element
to
be
ready
for
Bus
Mastering.
This
also
requires
preparing
physical (
memory)
region(
s)
for
use
with
DMA
and
handling
of
interrupts (
if
used).
3.
*
*Initiation
**
Tell
the
drive
how
much
data
to
transfer
and
which
way
before
telling
it
to
start.
Tell
the
BM
controller
which
way
data
is
meant
to
flow
and
tell
it
to
start/stop.

These
steps
are
broken
down
further
in
the
next
few
steps
each
with
their
own
overview
before
the
details.
Many
interrupts
will
be
generated
unless
configured
not
to.
Handling
these
interrupts
is
covered
in
its
own
section.

## Detection

<!-- todo: references for
 PCI classes
 OSdev PIO tutorial
BAR cases
Legacy port source
-->

-
Discover
PCI
devices
to
detect
if
there
is
an
IDE
controller
connected
via
PCI (
Class
0x1;
Subclass
0x1
in
PCI
Config
reg2
bits
24-31
and
16-32
respectively).
    -
    If
    not
    PCI,
    sorry
    this
    tutorial
    does
    not
    help
    much.
    This
    means
    that
    there
    cannot
    be
    DMA
    or
    busmastering.
    The
    PIO
    tutorials
    on
    OSdev.net
    should
    be
    sufficient.
-
Read
the
PCI
configuration
space
registers
to
discover
the
base
address
registers (
BAR#0-5)
and
the
ProgIF (
programming
interface)
byte.
The
contents
of
these
determine
how
to
communicate
with
the
IDE
controller.
Use
the
PCI
config
space
registers
to
control
the
PCI
status
and
PCI
command
registers.
-
Take
note
of
the
interrupt
pin/line
values
from
PCI
config
space
as
well.
-
If
ProgIF
bit7
is
set, (
PCI
Config
reg2
bit15)
then
the
IDE
controller
supports
BM.
If
not,
sorry
this
tutorial
does
not
help
much.
You
must
use
PIO
mode.

https://wiki.osdev.org/PCI_IDE_Controller#Detecting_a_PCI_IDE_Controller
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_configuration_space#Bus_enumeration

Each
PCI
base
address
register (
BAR)
contains
the
upper
28
bits
of
a
base
physical
address
or
base
IO
port
address
in
its
upper
28
bits.
The
lower
4
bits
describe
the
region
type,
where
bit0
specifies
whether
the
contained
value
is
a
physical
memory
address (
bit0 =
0)
or
an
IO
port (
bit0 =
1).
In
practice
this
means
that

```
if (BARX & 0x1)  addr = BARX & 0xFFF0 // should be cast to 16 bit I/O port
else addr = BARX & 0xFFFFFFF0 // addr is 32bit physical address
```

-
If
BAR0-3
are
all
zeros,
then
the
IDE
controller
requires
reading
and
writing
to
its
register
using
legacy
ports (
Primary:
0x1f0 -
0x1f8,
Secondary:
0x170 -
0x178).
IRQ
lines
14
and
15
are
used
for
the
BM
interrupts,
shared
with
the
IDE
interrupts.
In
this
case,
IDE
controller
interrupts
also
set
the
BM
interrupt
pin,
which
is
annoying.
-
If
BAR
0-3
are
populated,
then
the
BAR0
contains
the
memory
location
for
the
Base
Primary
Main
Registers (
replacing
port
0x1f0).
BAR1
contains
the
memory
location
for
the
Primary
Alt
register (
Alt
Status
at
offset
0x0
and
Alt
Drive
Select
at
0x1.
Not
to
be
confused
with
Main/Alt
drive).
BAR2
and
BAR3
contain
the
corresponding
values
for
the
Secondary
IDE
controller.
In
this
case,
any
BM
controller
interrupts
are
sent
to
the
interrupt
line/pin
as
described
in
the
PCI
config
space
registers.
-
BAR4
contains
the
base
address/port
for
the
BM
controller
register

NOTE:
IDE
controllers
use
8
bit
ports
for
communication (
except
when
using
PIO,
in
which
case
the
base
ports
must
be
access
as
16
bits
wide).
This
means
that
BAR0 +
7
is
the
location
of
the
Primary
Status
register
if
BAR0
is
non-zero,
for
example.
Otherwise,
this
is
accessed
using
I/O
port
0x1f0 +
7

## Configuration

At
this
point
you
should
know
where
the
PCI
configuration
space
starts,
where/how
to
access
IDE
controller
registers
and
where/how
to
access
the
BM
registers.
Now
we
must
know
what
to
do
with
them.

The
mains
configuration
steps
are:

1.
Select
the
drive
2.
Identify
whether
the
device
supports
PACKET
commands (
is
ATAPI
not
ATA).
3.
Detect
the
capabilities
of
the
device (
max
DMA
mode,
packet
size,
sector
and
block
size,
capacity)
4.
select
the
right
DMA
mode
5.
enable
busmastering
in
the
PCI
configuration
space
for
the
PCI
controller
6.
tell
the
busmaster
controller
what
memory
region(
s)
to
use
for
transfers

Step
6
can
be
performed
once
for
each
device
during
configuration,
or
can
be
performed
before
each
read/write
call,
with
the
memory
being
freed
in
between.
How
memory
and
physical
regions
are
handled
is
up
to
the
user.
The
simplest
case
is
to
set
and
forget
but
this
may
be
seen
as
wasteful,
especially
if
wanting
to
read
large
amounts
of
data
at
once.

### Select a drive

Write
the
correct
data
to
the
drive
select
IDE
command
register (
offset
0x6.
0xE0
for
main
drive
and
0xF0
for
alt
drive.
LBA
bit
is
always
set.)

Selecting
the
drive
can
take
time (~
400ns)
and
so
a
delay
should
be
introduced
here.
There
are
various
methods
such
as
reading
the
alt_status
port
15
times.
If
precise
timing
is
set
up,
a
short
sleep
may
be
more
suitable (
using
TSC
for
example).

### Check signature for ATA or ATAPI

After
a
reset,
the
IDE
command
registers
will
be
set
to
a
signature
to
differentiate
between
an
ATA
device
and
an
ATAPI
device.
This
tells
the
user
whether
to
use
the
ATA
IDENTIFY
command (
0xEC)
or
the
ATAPI
IDENTIFY
command (
0xA1)
to
read
data.
Either
way
the
output
data
is
accessed
using
PIO
reads.

To
initiate
a
reset:

1.
write
0x04 (
reset
cmd)
to
the
control
register (
0x3F6
for
main
drive
and
0x3F7
for
alt
drive).
2.
Wait
at
least
400ns.
3.
Write
0
to
the
same
control
register.
4.
Poll
the
alt_status
register
until
the
bsy
bit
clears (
bit
7).

Immediately
after
the
reset,
read
from
the
relevant
registers
and
compare
the
values
of
each
with
the
signatures
given
below:

| Name         | Reg Offset | ATA  | ATAPI |
|--------------|------------|------|-------|
| Sector count | 0x02       | 0x01 | 0x01  |
| LBA low      | 0x03       | 0x01 | 0x01  |
| LBA mid      | 0x04       | 0x00 | 0x14  |
| LBA high     | 0x05       | 0x00 | 0xEB  |

*
*Table
x
**:
ATA
and
ATAPI
device
signatures.

If
the
signatures
do
not
match,
then
something
has
gone
wrong.
It
might
help
to
check
the
alt
status
error
and
device_fault
bits,
and
if
one
is
set,
read
the
error
register
to
get
more
information.
It
might
be
that
the
reset
didn't
happen
properly.
Maybe
try
playing
with
timings
in
this
case.

### Detect capabilities

To
detect
the
capabilities
of
the
drive,
the
user
simply
issue
an
ATA
IDENTIFY
DEVICE
command (
0xEC)
or
an
ATAPI
INDENITIFY
PACKET
DEVICE
command (
0xA1)
to
the
device.
This
is
followed
by
reading
256
words
from
the
data
register (
offset
0x00
to
0x01)
as
16
bit
reads.

Normally
when
performing
a
non-SCSI
command,
parameters
for
these
commands
are
provided
by
writing
to
the
IDE
command
registers
before
writing
the
command
code
to
the
command
register.
In
this
case,
apart
from
the
device
select
register (
which
is
used
to
choose
which
drive
to
identify),
they
can
all
be
zero
or
left
untouched.

In
the
following
steps,
the
ERR,
DRQ
and
BSY
bits
are
bits
0,
3
and
7,
respectively,
of
the
alt (
or
main)
status
register.

1)
write
the
appropriate
command
code
to
the
IDE
command
register (
offset
0x7)
2)
wait
until
the
BSY
bit
is
cleared
3)
wait
until
the
DRQ
bit
is
set
4)
assert
that
ERR
is
not
set
5)
use
inw
to
read
256
words
of
identity
data (
512
bytes)

Below
are
some
resulting
fields
from
the
INDENTIFY
PACKET
DEVICE
command.
Not
all
256
words
will
be
detailed
here,
but
they
are
available
in
the
ATAPI6
draft.
Some
important
words
are:

Word
0:
TODO:
Serial
number
etc.
My
code
should
also
print
these
strings.
word
63:
MW
DMA
modes
word
88:
UDMA
modes

### Select the right DMA mode

### Configure the BM controller

## Initiation

At
this
point
the
system
should
be
ready
to
request
data
from
a
storage
device
and
to
initiate
a
DMA
transfer.
If
you
chose
to
remake
the
PRDT
for
each
transfer/set
of
transfers,
set
up
the
region
and
write
to
the
BM
PRDT
register
before
these
steps
and
free
the
memory
region
and
clear
the
PRDT
register
after
these
steps:

1.
Make
sure
the
BM
controller
is
ready
by
clearing
the
interrupt
and
error
bits
in
the
BM
status
register.
This
is
done
by
writing
ones
to
each
of
these
bits
of
the
register
to
toggle
it,
unlike
most
other
registers.
Writing
zeros
does
nothing
when
writing
to
the
BM
status
register.
2.
Write
zeros
to
IDE
command
register
offsets
1
to
5 (
inclusive)
before
sending
the
PACKET
command.
The
drive
select
register
should
be
set
for
the
correct
drive
already.
3.
Write
the
PACKET
command (
0xA0)
to
IDE
command
register (
offset
0x7)
to
start
a
SCSI
Packet
transfer.
4.
Wait
for
an
interrupt/poll
until
bsy
clears
and
DRQ
is
set.
This
indicates
that
the
drive
is
ready
to
receive
the
packet
via
PIO
interface
5.
Write
a
SCSI
packet
containing
appropriate
data
as (
either
6
or
8)
16
bit
words.
This
packet
is
12
or
16
bytes
for
ATAPI
even
if
using
a
SCSI
Packet
of
fewer
bytes (
extend
with
zeros).
The
size
is
determined
in
the
configuration
steps.
6.
Set
the
BM
command
register's
start/stop
bit (
bit
0)
to
1.
If
transferring
data
from
the
drive
to
memory,
this
register
should
be
set
to
0x9 (
8 +
1)
or
0x1
for
writing
to
the
drive.
7.
Wait
until
the
transfer
is
complete
which
will
emit
an
interrupt
and
the
drive
will
reset
it's
bsy
and
drq
bits
to
of
the
IDE
status
register
to
0.
8.
Copy
from (
if
reading
from
device)
or
clear (
if
copying
to
the
device)
memory
region(
s)

The
structure
of

DMA
and
create
a
physical
region
descriptor
table (
PRDT)
containing
and
physical
region
descriptor (
PRD)
entry
for
each
configured
physical
region.

### DMA MODES

There
are
three
main
levels
of
DMA:
SW
DMA,
multiword
DMA (
MW
DMA)
and
ultra
DMA (
UDMA).
For
the
user,
the
differences
are
not
important.
It
is
just
important
to
know
that
the
mode
you
select
is
supported
by
the
drive (
TODO:
and
the
other
hardware?
Does
the
BM/PCI
data
show
this?).
If
you're
interested,
see
wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDMA
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDMA_(computer).
UDMA
is
faster
than
MW
DMA
so
just
use
the
highest
UDMA
mode
supported
if
both
types
are
supported,
and
use
the
highest
MW
DMA
mode
if
not.
There
are
UDMA
modes
0
to
7
and
MW
DMA
modes
0
to
4.
SW
DMA
ranges
0
to
2
but
is
very
legacy,
and
will
not
be
discussed
here.
In
all
cases
the
largest
number
is
the
fastest.
Some
of
these
modes
are
defined
by
standards
that
are
not
ATA.

### Selecting DMA modes:

This
requires
sending
a
feature
select
command.
This
is
an
ATAPI
command
which
uses
IDE
register
values
as
input
parameters:
TODO:
write
what
the
registers
mean
and
what
other
options
are
for
these.

### Writing to the DMA Status Register

The
bits
in
the
DMA
Status
Register
are
toggled
by
writing
a
one
to
them.
That
means,
for
example,
that
in
order
to
CLEAR
the
interrupt
bit
you
must
write
to
the
status
register
with
this
bit
set.
You
do
NOT
write
a
0
to
clear
the
bit.

The
DMA
Command
Register
does
not
behave
like
this.
It
is
written
like
normal.

### Communication

#### ATA, ATAPI and Packets

These
are
SCSI
packets.
For
ATA
devices,
there
is
no
PACKET
command.
The
parameters
for
an
ATA
command
are
stored
in
the
IDE
controller
registers.
For
ATAPI
devices,
the
ATAPI
commands
use
the
IDE
controller
registers
as
well,
but
when
a
PACKET
is
sent,
most
of
these
registers
are
ignored,
only
the
drive
select
is
used (
TODO:
does
the
drive
select
and
a
register
to
request
a
specific
number
of
bytes
from
a
command?).
The
parameters
for
a
command
are
sent
as
a
SCSI
command
packet.

As
part
of
the
drive
config
steps,
you
should
read
the
IDENTIFY
data
or
the
IDENTIFY
PACKET
DEVICE
data (
512
bytes
as
256
words).
This
data
contains
the
device
configuration
information
such
as
the
DMA
modes
possible
on
this
device,
as
well
as
the
expected
number
of
bytes
to
be
sent
after
calling
PACKET
command.

#### How to DMA transfer

taken
and
the
expected

#### Highlighting the Difference

TODO:
e.g.
The
DMA
transfer
sets
bsy
then
sets
drq
without
resetting
busy,
and
doesn't
emit
an
interrupt
upon
completion

### Access

Each
register
in
PCI
config
space
is
32-bits
wide
and
must
be
accessed
as
32-bit
writes
and
reads.
They
are
memory
locations
and
so
must
be
access
using
pointers.
An
example
in
C:

```
u32 PCI_read_reg(u32* PCI_base, u32 register_id)
{
    return *(PCI_base + register_id*4);
}

u32 PCI_write_reg(u32* PCI_base, u32 register_id, u32 value)
{
    *(PCI_base + (register_id*4)) = value;
    return PCI_read_reg(PCI_base, register_id);
}
```

PCI
IDE
controllers
have
header
type
0
and
therefore
take
on
the
following
form.
